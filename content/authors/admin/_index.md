Hi there - I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University, studying artificial intelligence and clinical informatics. I am currently advised by [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/), [Curtis Langlotz](https://profiles.stanford.edu/curtis-langlotz), [Nigam Shah](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nigam-shah) and previously by [Matthew P. Lungren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z1UtMSYAAAAJ&hl=en). I am affiliated with Stanford's [MARVL](https://marvl.stanford.edu/index.html) lab and [AIMI](https://aimi.stanford.edu/) Center. 

My research focuses on the intersection of multimodal and self-supervised
learning, and the application of these methods to improve
healthcare.
