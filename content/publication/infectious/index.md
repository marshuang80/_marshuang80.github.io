abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision hold great promise for assisting medical staff, optimizing healthcare workflow, and improving patient outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic, which caused unprecedented stress on healthcare systems around the world, presented what seems to be a perfect
opportunity for AI to demonstrate its usefulness. However, of the several hundred medical imaging AI models developed for COVID-19, very few were fit for deployment in real-world settings, and some were potentially harmful. This review aims to examine the strengths and weaknesses of prior studies and provide recommendations for different stages of building useful AI models for medical imaging, among them: needfinding, dataset curation, model development and evaluation, and post-deployment considerations. In addition, this review summarizes the lessons learned to inform the scientific community about ways to create useful medical imaging AI in a future pandemic.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this review, we provide an evidence-based roadmap for how machine learning technologies in medical imaging can be used to battle ongoing and future pandemics. Specifically, we focus in each section on the four most pressing issues, namely - needfinding, dataset curation, model development and subsequent evaluation, and post-deployment considerations.
